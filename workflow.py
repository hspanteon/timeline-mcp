"""
Task workflows: the flow a task goes through in the dashboard, where it
stands, and every Claude run and decision on the way. Kept in the planner
SQLite file (<base>/database/timeline_task.db; tables workflows,
workflow_runs, workflow_events).

The flow is fixed (FLOW): Intake → Estimate (optional) → Develop (one
implementation step per run) → Self-review → Release to QA → Waiting on QA →
Fix QA findings (one finding per run, then back to Waiting on QA) → Release to
prod → Close. Nothing moves without a decision from you: starting the
workflow, running each step, approving or rejecting every run's result,
skipping a step (with a reason), saying what QA found, closing. Each decision
is a row in workflow_events.

A step runs interactively in a terminal (work_session), in the task's
worktree, with a session id chosen here (`claude --session-id`), so Claude
still asks before every edit and command. The prompt holds only the issue ID
and fixed text, and asks Claude to write timeline/<id>/runs/<run>.result.json
whenever it stops; the terminal writes <run>.exit when Claude exits. A run's
status comes from those two files (refresh_run) and its conversation from
Claude Code's own session log (read_transcript), and what its terminal is doing
right now (working, running a tool, waiting for you) from the tail of that log
(terminal_activity). Nothing runs in the background. What can happen next comes
from `actions`, which both the page and every POST go through, so the rules
live here and not in the page.
